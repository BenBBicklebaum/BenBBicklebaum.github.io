        <p>Brett started on January 15th, 1988 and was born to two loving parents in Great Neck New York.  He lived a happy childhood where he played sports and hated school.  Brett started coding in high school where he bought HTML for dummies and coded a page that required a password for his GF that contained a secret message.  Now, 31, Brett finds himself sitting in class writing the same type of code he did in between playing rounds of Counter Strike in 11th grade.</p>
